\description{
This dataset is sourced from the lme4 package, originally named 'sleepstudy'.
The average reaction time per day for subjects in a sleep deprivation study.
On day 0 the subjects had their normal amount of sleep.
Starting that night they were restricted to 3 hours of sleep per night.
The observations represent the average reaction time on a series of tests given each day to each subject.
